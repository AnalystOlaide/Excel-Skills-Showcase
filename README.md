#  Excel Skills Showcase Project

##  Project Overview

This project demonstrates practical Excel skills using real-world scenarios. The objective is to create a visually insightful, interactive Excel workbook that highlights the core competencies needed by a data analyst. The Excel tools showcased cover data cleaning, analysis, automation, and dashboard reporting.

##  Problem Statement

Professionals in business and data roles are often required to leverage Excel for diverse tasks including data wrangling, logic-based analysis, reporting, and automation. This project addresses the following core questions:

* How can Excel functions simplify large data operations?
* What logical and lookup functions are most effective for decision-making?
* How can dashboards provide real-time insights?
* How can automation reduce manual workloads?

## 🗂 Data Source

The data used is from an open-source dataset, curated to simulate regional sales performance (Midwest, South, West, etc.). It has been cleaned and structured to fit real-world business cases.

##  Data Structure

Columns include: `Region`, `Sales`, `Product`, `Customer Type`, `Order Date`, `Delivery Date`, `Discount`, `Profit`, `Quantity`, `Channel`, etc.

| Skill                      | Description                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Lookup Functions**       | Used `VLOOKUP`, `HLOOKUP` to retrieve values across different tables.                                           |
| **Logical Functions**      | Implemented `IF`, `AND`, `OR`, `IFS`, and nested formulas to drive decision-making logic.                       |
| **Data Validation**        | Created dropdown menus and restricted inputs to ensure clean, controlled data entry.                            |
| **Pivot Tables**           | Analyzed large data sets with dynamic summaries.                                                                |
| **Dashboards**             | Built interactive dashboards using charts and pivot tables to communicate insights.                             |
| **Conditional Formatting** | Applied color-coding and rules to reveal patterns, outliers, and KPIs.                                          |
| **Date Functions**         | Calculated durations, deadlines, and dynamic dates using `TODAY()`, `NOW()`, `DATEDIF()`, `NETWORKDAYS()`, etc. |
| **VBA & Macros**           | Automated repetitive tasks via recorded macros and basic VBA scripting.                                         |

##  Tool Used

**Microsoft Excel**

##  Excel Skills Applied

* **Power Query**: For importing, cleaning, and transforming data
* **Functions**: Lookup, Logical, Text, and Date functions
* **Data Validation**: Drop-down lists and input restrictions
* **Conditional Formatting**: To highlight trends and anomalies
* **Pivot Tables**: For summarization and multidimensional analysis
* **Dashboards**: For real-time reporting
* **VBA/Macros**: To automate repetitive tasks


##  Data Analysis Process

### Data Cleaning & Transformation

Power Query was used to load and preprocess the data—renaming columns, handling missing values, correcting data types, and unifying formatting standards.

###  Exploratory Data Analysis

Pivot tables and charts were created to explore trends, such as:

* Top performing products by sales and region
* Customer types and their purchase behaviors
* Performance of different sales channels
