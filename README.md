## 🔎 Data Analysis Process

### 🔹 Data Cleaning & Transformation

Power Query was used to load and preprocess the data—renaming columns, handling missing values, correcting data types, and unifying formatting standards.

### 🔹 Exploratory Data Analysis

Pivot tables and charts were created to explore trends, such as:

* Top performing products by sales and region
* Customer types and their purchase behaviors
* Performance of different sales channels
