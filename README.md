# üìä Excel Skills Showcase Project

## üß© Problem Statement

In today‚Äôs data-driven world, organizations rely heavily on tools like Microsoft Excel for everything from data cleaning to reporting and automation. This project was created to **demonstrate mastery of essential Excel skills** that are critical in data analysis and business intelligence roles.

The aim is to simulate real-world use cases by building a comprehensive Excel workbook that highlights practical functions and tools often used by professionals. From logic-based formulas to dashboards and automation, this project serves as a **portfolio-ready artifact** for job applications, interviews, and upskilling.

## üìÅ Data Source

The data used is from an **open-source dataset**, structured to resemble regional business performance data (e.g., Midwest, South, West, etc.). This allows for exploration, cleaning, transformation, and analysis in a format similar to what is encountered in many workplace scenarios.
